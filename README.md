# Pentesting
My first pentesting scripts

* *basic_auth.py*: brute force script to bypass Basic Authentication in HTTP requests. 

  USAGE: **python3 basic_auth.py**. You will be asked to provide a valid user and the URL of the unauthorized site.
         Before executing it, you should edit the path to the dictionary that will be used. 
  
  
  
* *xor_base64_sid.py*: It can be used both to find the SID corresponding to a specific user, or to find the user corresponding to a specific SID, as long as you know the XOR key with which they have been built, if that's the case. This only works if SID and user parameters have been subjected to a Base64 coding process.  

  - Find the user: Code the SID in Base64 > Build XOR Function (data=coded SID, Key) > Output: valid user in plain text.
  - Find the SID: Build XOR Function (data=valid user, Key) > Code the output in Base64 > SID in plain text.

  USAGE: **python3 xor_base64_sid.py**. You will be asked if you want to find a user ("usuario") or a sid ("sid"). Then you should provide the valid XOR key, in order to have success.
