# Pentesting
My first pentesting scripts

* **basic_auth.py**: brute force script to bypass an HTTP Basic Authentication request. 

  USAGE: *python3 basic_auth.py*. You will be asked to provide a valid user and the URL of the unauthorized site.
         Before executing it, you should edit the path to the dictionary that will be used. 

* **digest_brute_RFC2617.py**: brute force script based in RFC2617 HTTP Digest Authentication.

  USAGE: *python3 digest_brute*. Before executing this script, you will need to intercept the request (with Burp, for example), and edit the values of uri, qop, nc and cnonce in the script. If necessary, do so with auth. You will also need to provide a valid user, the URL, and the path to the dictionary to be used. It's also important to review in the Burp request if parameters are delimited with quotes or not. By default, only algorithm, qop and nc will not. Check it.
  
  
* **xor_base64_sid.py**: It can be used both to find the SID corresponding to a specific user, or to find the user corresponding to a specific SID, as long as you know the XOR key with which they have been built, if that's the case. This only works if SID and user parameters have been subjected to a Base64 coding process.  

  - Find the user: Code the SID in Base64 > Build XOR Function (data=coded SID, Key) > Output: valid user in plain text.
  - Find the SID: Build XOR Function (data=valid user, Key) > Code the output in Base64 > SID in plain text.

  USAGE: *python3 xor_base64_sid.py*. You will be asked if you want to find a user ("usuario") or a sid ("sid"). Then you should provide the valid XOR key, in order to have success.
